      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          I was born in a remote area but qualified enough to be selected to
          attend a Singaporean-based curriculum high school, which was seen as
          one of the best high schools in Cambodia at that time. During my three
          years in high school, I was recognized as an outstanding student and
          was awarded as one of the overall top scorers every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides excellent academic performance, I was eager to go beyond the
          classroom, participating in extracurricular activities, working on
          projects, and joining competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          After high school graduation, while most students went straight to
          university, I took a 6-month break. During that time, my friends and I
          launched a startup aimed at helping university students find paid
          internships for free. It still operates today.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time passed, I grew personally and professionally, meeting
          countless people, facing challenges, and witnessing various situations
          around me. In my 20s, I began to realize the core values I hold onto:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integrity:</strong> Being ethical and using my knowledge in
            the right way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsibility:</strong> Committing to my work and accepting
            the consequences of my actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contribution:</strong> Passionate about giving back to the
            community and helping others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the future, I want to become a full-stack web developer, bringing
          meaningful technology and solutions to address problems in Cambodia.
          While I am still exploring which industry to focus on, one thing
          remains clearâ€”I have a strong interest in startups.
